- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a remote full-time employment from anywhere type position as a computer operator, data tape operator/librarian, site admnistrator or system engineer.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning that a structured job with a specific checklist/routine/sequence/result/delivery/pattern would be ideal for me.
